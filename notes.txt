#types of components
    1. function based
            const App = () => {
                return <div>
                    <SearchBar />
                </div>;
            };
    2. class based
            class App2 extends React.Component{
                render() {
                    return <div>Hi from app2 !</div>
                }
            };

#state in react
    only in class based components
    state is a plain JS object that is use to record the user events in react.
    Each class based component that we define has its own state object.
    Whenever a component's state is changed, the component immediately re-renders and also forces all of its children component to re-render.

    To use state, we need to initialise it inside the constructor method of class

    class App2 extends React.Component{
        constructor(props){
            super(props);       //calling method of a parent class

            this.state = {};
        }
        render() {
            return <div>Hi from app2 !</div>
        }
    };
